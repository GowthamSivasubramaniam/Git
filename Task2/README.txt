touch shouldbeignored.txt
touch havetoappear.txt
touch .gitignore
 git add .
git status
        On branch main
        Changes to be committed:
        (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
                new file:   .gitignore
                new file:   havetoappear.txt

The above is the process done and before using git status all the changes have to be tracked using git add .

This is the objective of this task2 "have to create .gitignore file and track the files that have appear on github.
